## About me

Hi! I’m Daniel Panea, a data scientist and AI engineer with a background in theoretical physics and a passion for intelligent systems that work in the real world. I help companies move beyond experimentation and deploy AI solutions that are modular, efficient, and fully under their control.

Whether you're trying to eliminate repetitive work with automation or integrate large language models into your existing tools, my mission is the same: deliver AI that’s reliable, privacy-conscious, and actually improves your bottom line.

My journey started with a PhD in theoretical physics and led me into high-performance computing, machine learning, and eventually AI engineering. I’ve spent the last 3+ years building custom algorithms, data pipelines and AI/ML systems across the semiconductor industry, geolocation, education, and enterprise automation. Always with a focus on data sovereignty and open infrastructure.

## Why work with me?

Here's what sets me apart and how I can help drive value for your business:

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :material-lock:{ .lg .middle } Privacy-First Approach
  
    ---

    I believe in building AI you own and control. I specialize in open-source and on-premise solutions that keep your data private, secure, and vendor-independent.
  
-   :material-layers:{ .lg .middle } End-to-End Systems
  
    ---

    From model training to deployment and monitoring, I design modular AI workflows that integrate seamlessly into your business operations and scale with your needs.

-   :material-school:{ .lg .middle } Deep Technical Foundations
  
    ---

    With a PhD in theoretical physics and a master’s in machine learning, I bring analytical rigor and systems thinking to every project I touch.

-   :material-lightbulb-on:{ .lg .middle } Pragmatic Innovation
  
    ---

    I don’t chase buzzwords, I build solutions that solve real problems. Every system I design is grounded in practical impact, measurable outcomes, and maintainability.
